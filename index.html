		<p>Like everybody else, I do more than one thing (if limited to a single noun, I'd want to be a <em>friend</em> please). I'm an academic historian, have an art practice making visual theatre and am a current MSc student in ecology.</p>
		
		<p>But thats not why we're here. I offer you 25 years' award-winning experience as a creative technolgist. I have powerful, unexpected ideas and I make them real in images, words, code, objects and machines. Let's collaborate. I'm guyjohnhilton (all one word, just like that) and that's at gmail dot com.</p>
